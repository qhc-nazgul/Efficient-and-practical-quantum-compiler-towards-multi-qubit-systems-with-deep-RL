# Efficient-and-practical-quantum-compiler-towards-multi-qubit-systems-with-deep-RL
In this repository, we will upload our data and code (in Python) about the paper Efficient and practical quantum compiler towards multi-qubit systems with deep reinforcement learning (https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06904). In this code, we demonstrate an RL training process to compile the single-qubit quantum gates. The basis gate set is set to be the HRC basis set in https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0111031.

We leverage the RL environment developed in https://github.com/yuanhangzhang98/ml_quantum_compiling. We use a more powerful RL algorithm (deep Q-learning) to train the compiling process. And our scheme can be applied to the case of two or more qubits. If you have any questions, please contact us at qhc.statistics@whu.edu.cn
